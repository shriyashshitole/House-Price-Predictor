## Data Science Regression Project: Predicting Home Prices in Bangalore

### Project Overview

This project aims to predict home prices in Bangalore using a regression model. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and undergoes data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training to build an accurate predictive model.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found here:
Kaggle - Bengaluru House Price Data

### Steps Involved

#### Data Loading: Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

#### Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and drop irrelevant features.

#### Feature Engineering:

Add new features such as BHK (Bedrooms, Hall, Kitchen).

Process and clean the total_sqft feature, handling range values and unit conversions.

#### Model Building:

Train regression models to predict house prices.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

### Dependencies

##### Python

##### Pandas

##### NumPy

##### Scikit-Learn

##### Matplotlib

##### Seaborn

### Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bangalore-home-prices.git
cd bangalore-home-prices

Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis.

### Results

The model is trained and evaluated on the dataset, and its accuracy is assessed using regression metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.
